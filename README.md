Automatic Detection of Deep Fakes

Advances in artificial intelligence make it increasingly easy to create visually-convincing fake contents such as images, videos and
audios. The term “Deep fakes” refers to the fake contents generated by deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly generative
adversarial networks (GANs), which can learn useful data statistics from the training set and generate fake contents that are hardly
detectable by naked eyes. Some examples of deep fakes can be found here. Deep fakes pose huge threats to many aspects of the
society. This project aims to develop effective automatic algorithms for detecting deep fakes. In this project, you may engage in:
1. Literature review on different methods of generating and detecting deep fakes.
2. Implementing one popular existing deep fake detection algorithm and testing its performance.
3. Designing and developing a new detection algorithm (possibly based on the implemented existing algorithm
